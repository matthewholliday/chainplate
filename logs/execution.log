 Samovar & Smoke — a scent inspired by the irrepressible warmth and wit of Whoopi Goldberg

Imagine a moonlit railway platform outside Saint Petersburg, where a samovar puffs steam into the cold air and a theatre troupe gathers around a crate of smoked ham, black bread and hot tea. Samovar & Smoke captures that unlikely, magnetic juxtaposition: the savory intimacy of a shared meal, the icicle-clear brightness of a Russian night, and the unapologetic, laugh-out-loud charisma of an icon. The result is a luxurious, utterly singular fragrance — part gourmand, part forest smoke, all velvet-hearted personality.

The opening is bright and electric: a crystalline shot of vodka accord brushed with frozen bergamot and pink pepper — cold, vivacious, and a little mischievous. A delicate saline shimmer recalls the sheen on cured meat, then unfolds into an artful prosciutto accord: honey-glazed fat, a whisper of black pepper, smoked sea salt and a hint of thyme. It’s gourmand without cloying — savory and sophisticated, like a chef’s secret cure.

At the heart, Russian elements take center stage. Smoked birch tar and samovar tea lend a tannic, leathery smoke; a slice of toasted rye bread and dark honey anchor the composition in rustic warmth. Juniper berries and a whisper of clove add resinous clarity, evoking winter forests and a late-night chat by a wood fire. This is where Whoopi’s spirit arrives: earthy, generous, unpretentious — a voice that fills the room and makes everything around it feel more vivid.

The dry-down is long, sumptuous and quietly defiant. Warm labdanum and amber wrap the base in molten golden glow, while vetiver and a soft leather accord bring depth and a gentle, rugged elegance. A sensual trail of tonka and clean musk lingers like the memory of laughter, the afterglow of a toast, the warmth that stays on your skin long after the party has moved on.

Samovar & Smoke is crafted for the bold and curious: a unisex evening statement that refuses to be predictable. Wear it when you want to provoke conversation, when you want warmth in a white winter, when you want a scent that is simultaneously nourishing and theatrical — much like the woman who inspired it: soulful, sly, and utterly unforgettable.

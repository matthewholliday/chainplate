 Hello, Margherita — L'Étoile de Paris

Imagine a late summer night in Paris when the marquee lights flicker and a whisper of wood smoke curls out of an open pizzeria window onto the Seine. Hello, Margherita captures that improbable, irresistible moment where street‑food intimacy meets red‑carpet glamour. It is a gourmand and savory olfactive sonnet: warm, creamy, and utterly metropolitan — part freshly baked pizza from a beloved corner forno, part champagne toast on a balcony overlooking the Eiffel Tower, part a celebrity’s breezy, unforgettable greeting as she passes you by.

Top: a sparkling first impression — effervescent champagne accord and sun‑bright bergamot cut through a green burst of basil and lemon zest. A subtle, aldehydic shimmer (the “hello” of the fragrance) lifts the composition like flashbulbs on arrival, giving it an immediate, star‑struck luminosity.

Heart: the heart is the idea made perfume — a voluptuous tomato leaf accord warmed by a lactonic, dreamy mozzarella note that reads more like warm cream than cheese, creamy and slightly milky, deliciously refined. Gentle sprigs of oregano and rosemary mingle with a soft floral veil of iris and a hint of Bulgarian rose, translating rustic toppings into haute couture elegance. A whisper of warm espresso and buttery croissant crumb gives a Parisian café aroma, tying the gourmand to place.

Base: close your eyes and imagine the last bite — the char of the wood‑fired crust rendered as toasted bread accord and a faint, sophisticated smokiness (smoky birch and cade) softened by golden amber, a whisper of salted tonka, and a powdery suede‑musk that leaves a lingering, intimate trail. A polished patchouli and vetiver backbone anchors the scent with Parisian gravitas and a touch of nocturnal mystery.

Who wears Hello, Margherita? The modern gourmand who moves between sidewalk cafés and velvet‑roped premieres, someone who is as comfortable ordering a slice under a streetlamp as she is stepping out at midnight for champagne. It’s playful yet refined, savory yet sumptuous — a perfume that surprises and seduces, like a perfect slice in a city that loves beauty.

Presentation: the bottle is a hand‑blown flacon, curvaceous like a pizza slice, sealed with a gold‑rimmed cap engraved simply with “Hello.” It comes nestled in a matte black box stamped with a tiny illustration of the Seine and a red wax seal — part luxe gift, part secret invitation to an after‑hours Parisian feast.

Hello, Margherita is a celebration of contrasts — the comfort of the kitchen and the dazzle of the stage — an olfactory hello that lingers, inviting you back for one more unforgettable bite.

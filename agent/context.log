===================== Agent Context Overview ====================
Consider the following when carrying out your tasks: 

Log of what has been done so far: No memories have been recorded so far.


DESCRIPTION: Call the Open-Meteo API to retrieve current weather (temperature in Fahrenheit) for Chandler, Arizona (lat 33.3062, lon -111.8413).

CHAIN OF THOUGHT: To report the current temperature in Chandler, AZ I need real-time weather data. The plan specifies using the Open-Meteo API as the primary source with Fahrenheit as the default. Therefore a fetch call to the Open-Meteo endpoint with the Chandler coordinates and current_weather=true is necessary to obtain current_weather.temperature and timestamp so I can format and validate the result before presenting it to the user.

Agent called MCP tool:

  TOOL: 'fetch'

  SERVICE: 'fetch'

  ARGUMENTS: {'url': 'https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast?latitude=33.3062&longitude=-111.8413&current_weather=true&temperature_unit=fahrenheit', 'max_length': 5000, 'start_index': 0, 'raw': False}

  RESPONSE: 
The sites robots.txt (https://api.open-meteo.com/robots.txt), specifies that autonomous fetching of this page is not allowed, <useragent>ModelContextProtocol/1.0 (Autonomous; +https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers)</useragent>
<url>https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast?latitude=33.3062&longitude=-111.8413&current_weather=true&temperature_unit=fahrenheit</url><robots>
User-agent: *
Disallow: /
</robots>
The assistant must let the user know that it failed to view the page. The assistant may provide further guidance based on the above information.
The assistant can tell the user that they can try manually fetching the page by using the fetch prompt within their UI.


DESCRIPTION: Call the wttr.in JSON endpoint for Chandler, AZ as a fallback to obtain current temperature in Fahrenheit.

CHAIN OF THOUGHT: The Open-Meteo request was blocked by robots.txt for autonomous agents, so the primary source cannot be fetched. To achieve the goal of reporting the current temperature for Chandler, AZ without asking the user for more input, use the fallback public JSON endpoint wttr.in which provides current temperature (including Fahrenheit). Fetching wttr.in/Chandler?format=j1 will allow parsing current_condition[0].temp_F and time and continue the plan.

Agent called MCP tool:

  TOOL: 'fetch'

  SERVICE: 'fetch'

  ARGUMENTS: {'url': 'https://wttr.in/Chandler?format=j1', 'max_length': 5000, 'start_index': 0, 'raw': False}

<error>Content truncated. Call the fetch tool with a start_index of 5000 to get more content.</error>

Your current goals are: Tell me what the temperature is in Chandler, Arizona.

Your current plan (if any) is: Plan to determine the current temperature in Chandler, Arizona

1. Confirm method and units
   - Decide which source/API to use (primary = Open-Meteo API; fallback = wttr.in or another public endpoint).
   - Default to Fahrenheit (ask user later if they prefer Celsius).

2. Resolve location coordinates
   - Use Chandler, Arizona coordinates: latitude 33.3062, longitude -111.8413.
   - (If needed, fetch a geocoding service to verify the coordinates.)

3. Build the primary API request
   - Construct Open-Meteo URL with current weather and Fahrenheit units, e.g.:
     https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast?latitude=33.3062&longitude=-111.8413&current_weather=true&temperature_unit=fahrenheit
   - Plan to call fetch with that URL (max_length sufficient for JSON; raw=false is fine).

4. Call the primary source using fetch
   - Execute fetch(url).
   - If the response is truncated, re-fetch with a larger max_length or use start_index to retrieve remainder.

5. Parse the response
   - Parse JSON and extract current_weather.temperature and current_weather.time.
   - Record units from the request (Fahrenheit) and note the timestamp (likely in ISO/UTC).

6. Convert/timestamp handling
   - Convert the returned time to local Chandler time (MST/MDT) for clarity, if necessary.
   - Optionally convert temperature to Celsius if the user prefers.

7. Validate and format the result
   - Verify the temperature value is reasonable (e.g., between -100 and 150 Â°F).
   - Prepare a concise, human-readable message stating temperature, units, timestamp, and data source.

8. Fallback steps if primary fails
   - If Open-Meteo is unavailable or returns malformed data, call wttr.in JSON endpoint:
     https://wttr.in/Chandler?format=j1
   - Parse wttr.in JSON for current_condition[0].temp_F (or temp_C) and time.
   - If that fails, try another public source or report inability to retrieve data and ask user how to proceed (e.g., provide API key).

9. Error handling and retries
   - Implement up to 2 retries on transient fetch/network errors with short backoff.
   - If persistent error, surface a clear error message explaining the failure and next steps.

10. Deliver the answer and follow-up
   - Respond with the current temperature in Chandler, AZ (value, units, local timestamp, source).
   - Ask if the user wants Celsius instead, more detail (humidity/wind), or a continual update schedule.

Notes on tool usage
- Use the provided fetch tool for all HTTP requests.
- Use max_length large enough to capture JSON (default 5000 should be sufficient).
- Use raw=false unless the endpoint returns HTML that must be inspected raw.

I will now proceed to fetch the temperature using the primary plan (Open-Meteo) unless you want a different source or units. Do you prefer Fahrenheit or Celsius?

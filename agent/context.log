DESCRIPTION: Fetch the concise temperature string for Chandler, AZ from wttr.in to obtain the current temperature quickly and parseably.

CHAIN OF THOUGHT: Per the plan, the fastest reliable way to get the current temperature is to query wttr.in with the concise format endpoint. The user gave no unit preference, so I will default to Fahrenheit and include a Celsius conversion when reporting. Calling the fetch tool for https://wttr.in/Chandler?format=3 is the next required action to obtain a simple parseable temperature string (e.g., 'Chandler: +93°F'), which I can parse and report with source and timestamp. If this call fails or returns ambiguous output, the plan specifies retrying or moving to the NWS API next.

Agent called MCP tool:

  TOOL: 'fetch'

  SERVICE: 'fetch'

  ARGUMENTS: {'url': 'https://wttr.in/Chandler?format=3', 'max_length': 1000, 'raw': False}

  RESPONSE: 
Content type text/plain; charset=utf-8 cannot be simplified to markdown, but here is the raw content:
Contents of https://wttr.in/Chandler?format=3:
Chandler: ☀️   +85°F

Your current goals are: Tell me what the temperature is in Chandler, Arizona.

Your current plan (if any) is: Step-by-step plan for obtaining and reporting the current temperature in Chandler, Arizona

1. Clarify any user preferences (optional)
   - If needed, ask the user whether they prefer Fahrenheit or Celsius. If no preference is given, default to reporting Fahrenheit and include a Celsius conversion.

2. Try a simple, reliable plain-text endpoint first (fastest & easiest to parse)
   - Target: wttr.in which provides concise, parseable output.
   - Fetch example (tool parameters):
     - url: "https://wttr.in/Chandler?format=3"
     - max_length: 1000
     - raw: false
   - Expected output format: "Chandler: +93°F" (or similar)
   - Parse the returned string for the temperature and units.

3. If step 2 fails or output is ambiguous, try a second reliable source (National Weather Service)
   - Use the NWS API (requires coordinate lookup then forecast):
     - Determine coordinates for Chandler, AZ (approx 33.3062,-111.8413) or use NWS point lookup:
       - Fetch: "https://api.weather.gov/points/33.3062,-111.8413"
     - From that JSON, get the "forecastHourly" or "forecast" URL, then fetch that URL to extract current temperature.
   - Fetch example(s):
     - url: "https://api.weather.gov/points/33.3062,-111.8413"
     - max_length: 5000
     - raw: false
   - Parse JSON for current temperature (units likely Celsius in some fields or F depending on endpoint); convert units if necessary.

4. Alternate web sources if NWS or wttr.in are inaccessible
   - weather.com (harder to parse HTML), AccuWeather, or Open-Meteo/OpenWeatherMap APIs.
   - For web pages, set raw: true to get HTML and search for patterns like "\d+°F" or "current-temp".
   - Example fetch for wttr alternative: "https://www.weather.com/weather/today/l/Chandler+AZ?canonicalCityId=..." (may require finding correct URL via search)

5. Parsing strategy
   - First try simple regex patterns on returned text/HTML/JSON:
     - Patterns: [-+]?\d+\s?°\s?[FfCc] or JSON field names like "temperature", "temp", "value" with unit fields.
   - If JSON, use keys directly (e.g., properties.periods[0].temperature).
   - Normalize the temperature and unit, convert to the user's preferred unit if needed.

6. Validation and timestamp
   - Record the time of the retrieved observation (UTC or local time) from the source if available; otherwise, use current time and note that it is the time the query was made.
   - Include the source name and a URL in the final reply.

7. Error handling and retries
   - If the first fetch fails (network error, unexpected format), retry once.
   - If parsing fails, try the next source in the list (wttr.in → NWS → weather.com → AccuWeather).
   - If all attempts fail, inform the user and offer to try again or ask for permission to use an API key (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) if they prefer.

8. Present the result to the user
   - Provide a concise statement: current temperature in Chandler, AZ with units, time of observation, source citation, and optional Celsius/Fahrenheit conversion.
   - Example: "Current temperature in Chandler, AZ is 93°F (34°C) as of 3:12 PM MST — source: wttr.in (https://wttr.in/Chandler)."

9. Follow-up
   - Ask if the user wants additional details (humidity, forecast, hourly outlook) or a different location/unit.

Notes about tool usage
- Use the provided fetch tool to retrieve the content. Example fetch payload for the first attempt:
  { "url": "https://wttr.in/Chandler?format=3", "max_length": 1000, "raw": false }
- If parsing HTML, set "raw": true and increase max_length to capture needed content.

That plan will be executed stepwise: try wttr.in first, then NWS, then other web sources, parse temperature, validate time/source, and report back with citations and unit handling. Would you like me to proceed and fetch the current temperature now?

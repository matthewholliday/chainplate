Plan to determine the current temperature in Chandler, Arizona

1. Confirm method and units
   - Decide which source/API to use (primary = Open-Meteo API; fallback = wttr.in or another public endpoint).
   - Default to Fahrenheit (ask user later if they prefer Celsius).

2. Resolve location coordinates
   - Use Chandler, Arizona coordinates: latitude 33.3062, longitude -111.8413.
   - (If needed, fetch a geocoding service to verify the coordinates.)

3. Build the primary API request
   - Construct Open-Meteo URL with current weather and Fahrenheit units, e.g.:
     https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast?latitude=33.3062&longitude=-111.8413&current_weather=true&temperature_unit=fahrenheit
   - Plan to call fetch with that URL (max_length sufficient for JSON; raw=false is fine).

4. Call the primary source using fetch
   - Execute fetch(url).
   - If the response is truncated, re-fetch with a larger max_length or use start_index to retrieve remainder.

5. Parse the response
   - Parse JSON and extract current_weather.temperature and current_weather.time.
   - Record units from the request (Fahrenheit) and note the timestamp (likely in ISO/UTC).

6. Convert/timestamp handling
   - Convert the returned time to local Chandler time (MST/MDT) for clarity, if necessary.
   - Optionally convert temperature to Celsius if the user prefers.

7. Validate and format the result
   - Verify the temperature value is reasonable (e.g., between -100 and 150 Â°F).
   - Prepare a concise, human-readable message stating temperature, units, timestamp, and data source.

8. Fallback steps if primary fails
   - If Open-Meteo is unavailable or returns malformed data, call wttr.in JSON endpoint:
     https://wttr.in/Chandler?format=j1
   - Parse wttr.in JSON for current_condition[0].temp_F (or temp_C) and time.
   - If that fails, try another public source or report inability to retrieve data and ask user how to proceed (e.g., provide API key).

9. Error handling and retries
   - Implement up to 2 retries on transient fetch/network errors with short backoff.
   - If persistent error, surface a clear error message explaining the failure and next steps.

10. Deliver the answer and follow-up
   - Respond with the current temperature in Chandler, AZ (value, units, local timestamp, source).
   - Ask if the user wants Celsius instead, more detail (humidity/wind), or a continual update schedule.

Notes on tool usage
- Use the provided fetch tool for all HTTP requests.
- Use max_length large enough to capture JSON (default 5000 should be sufficient).
- Use raw=false unless the endpoint returns HTML that must be inspected raw.

I will now proceed to fetch the temperature using the primary plan (Open-Meteo) unless you want a different source or units. Do you prefer Fahrenheit or Celsius?

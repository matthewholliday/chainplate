DESCRIPTION: Fetch the concise temperature string for Chandler, AZ from wttr.in to obtain the current temperature quickly and parseably.

CHAIN OF THOUGHT: Per the plan, the fastest reliable way to get the current temperature is to query wttr.in with the concise format endpoint. The user gave no unit preference, so I will default to Fahrenheit and include a Celsius conversion when reporting. Calling the fetch tool for https://wttr.in/Chandler?format=3 is the next required action to obtain a simple parseable temperature string (e.g., 'Chandler: +93°F'), which I can parse and report with source and timestamp. If this call fails or returns ambiguous output, the plan specifies retrying or moving to the NWS API next.

Agent called MCP tool:

  TOOL: 'fetch'

  SERVICE: 'fetch'

  ARGUMENTS: {'url': 'https://wttr.in/Chandler?format=3', 'max_length': 1000, 'raw': False}

  RESPONSE: 
Content type text/plain; charset=utf-8 cannot be simplified to markdown, but here is the raw content:
Contents of https://wttr.in/Chandler?format=3:
Chandler: ☀️   +85°F


DESCRIPTION: Parsed the wttr.in concise response for Chandler, AZ and converted the temperature to Celsius; reporting the temperature, source, and query time.

CHAIN OF THOUGHT: I already fetched the concise wttr.in endpoint as planned and received the plain response 'Chandler: ☀️   +85°F'. This is directly parseable, so no further tool calls are necessary. I'll parse the temperature (+85°F), convert it to Celsius, and report the result with the source and note that wttr.in's concise output does not include an observation timestamp so I will use the time the query was made.

I have completed the task successfully.

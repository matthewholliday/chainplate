DESCRIPTION: Use Notion's search API to find the 'Dog Breeds' page so we can obtain its page_id and create the Wheaten Terrier page and sub-pages under it.

CHAIN OF THOUGHT: To create the Wheaten Terrier page and its three sub-pages under the 'Dog Breeds' page, I first need the Notion page ID for the existing 'Dog Breeds' page to use as the parent. The available tools include a search endpoint, so calling the Notion search API with the query 'Dog Breeds' and filtering for pages will locate the correct parent page ID. This is the necessary next step before creating any new pages.

DESCRIPTION: Create a new Notion page titled 'Wheaten Terrier' with parent set to the existing 'Dog Breeds' page so we can then create sub-pages under it.

CHAIN OF THOUGHT: The search response returned the Notion page ID for 'Dog Breeds' (2692177e-9a4d-800c-8a4b-e28721e5cbd1). The next required step in the plan is to create the Wheaten Terrier page as a child of that 'Dog Breeds' page so we have a parent page ID to attach the three sub-pages to. Therefore I should call the Notion API to create a new page with its parent set to the found Dog Breeds page.

DESCRIPTION: Create the 'Wheaten Terrier — History and Origin' sub-page under the existing Wheaten Terrier page and include a brief summary of the breed's history and origin.

CHAIN OF THOUGHT: The Wheaten Terrier parent page has already been created (page_id 2692177e-9a4d-8156-a5fa-e67a90662318). The next immediate action in the plan is to create the three required sub-pages under that parent. I'll proceed by creating the first sub-page, 'History and Origin', using the Notion API POST page endpoint. Creating the first sub-page now is consistent with the plan and allows subsequent creation of the remaining two sub-pages in follow-up steps.

DESCRIPTION: Create the 'Wheaten Terrier — Physical Characteristics and Appearance' sub-page under the existing Wheaten Terrier page and add a detailed description of size, coat, color, proportions, and grooming needs.

CHAIN OF THOUGHT: Two of the three required sub-pages remain: 'Physical Characteristics and Appearance' and 'Temperament and Behavior'. The Wheaten Terrier parent page was created and its page_id is available (2692177e-9a4d-8156-a5fa-e67a90662318). The next immediate action consistent with the plan is to create the Physical Characteristics sub-page under that parent with a detailed description of the breed's physical traits, so I'll call the Notion create-page endpoint with the parent set to the Wheaten Terrier page and include a descriptive paragraph as the page content.

The head is strong with a moderate stop, almond-shaped dark eyes, and small-to-medium drop ears set well; the tail is carried high and lively (docking varies by region). The coat texture is soft and wavy to slightly curly, ranging from pale cream through gold to deep wheaten shades; puppies are often darker and lighten with age. The breed's build supports energetic, balanced movement; grooming requires regular brushing and periodic trimming or hand-stripping to prevent matting and maintain the characteristic silky look."}}]}, 'type': 'paragraph'}]}

DESCRIPTION: Create the 'Wheaten Terrier — Temperament and Behavior' sub-page under the existing Wheaten Terrier page, including a detailed description of the breed's temperament and behavior.

CHAIN OF THOUGHT: Two sub-pages have already been created under the Wheaten Terrier parent page (History and Origin; Physical Characteristics and Appearance). The remaining required sub-page is Temperament and Behavior. Creating that sub-page via the Notion API is the next concrete step to complete the plan and satisfy the user's requirements. A tool call to create a Notion page (API-post-page) with the Wheaten Terrier page as parent and a detailed temperament/behavior paragraph is necessary and consistent with prior successful calls.

They are intelligent and quick to learn but can show a streak of independence or stubbornness, so consistent, positive-reinforcement training and early socialization are important. As terriers, they may display prey-driven behaviors toward small animals and can be assertive with other dogs unless socialized; supervised introductions and structured play help. Wheatens are alert and spirited without being overly aggressive, making them good watchdogs while remaining generally friendly to strangers when properly raised. Regular physical exercise, mental stimulation, and firm but gentle leadership help prevent boredom and undesirable behaviors, and with proper training and socialization they adapt well to active families and multi-dog households.'}}]}, 'type': 'paragraph'}]}

DESCRIPTION: All required Notion pages were created: the Wheaten Terrier parent page under 'Dog Breeds' and the three specified sub-pages with their respective content. Task is complete.

CHAIN OF THOUGHT: The search located the existing 'Dog Breeds' page and returned its page_id. I then created the 'Wheaten Terrier' page as a child of that Dog Breeds page, and subsequently created the three required sub-pages (History and Origin; Physical Characteristics and Appearance; Temperament and Behavior) under the Wheaten Terrier page, each with the requested titles and descriptive content. All API calls returned successful page objects and URLs, indicating the required pages were created. No further tool calls or user input are needed to satisfy the stated goals.

I have completed the task successfully.

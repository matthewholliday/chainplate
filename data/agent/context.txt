Consider the following when carrying out your tasks: 

Log of what has been done so far: 

DESCRIPTION: Fetch the Open-Meteo current weather JSON for Chandler, AZ (latitude=33.3062, longitude=-111.8413) to obtain the current temperature and observation time.

CHAIN OF THOUGHT: The plan's next step is to retrieve current weather data from the primary source (Open-Meteo) for Chandler, AZ using the known coordinates. A fetch call is required to get the JSON response so we can extract current_weather.temperature and timestamp, convert units, and present the result. No further user input is needed and Open-Meteo requires no API key, so proceeding with the fetch is consistent with the plan.

Agent called MCP tool:

  TOOL: 'fetch'

  SERVICE: 'fetch'

  ARGUMENTS: {'url': 'https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast?latitude=33.3062&longitude=-111.8413&current_weather=true', 'max_length': 20000, 'raw': True}

  RESPONSE: 
The sites robots.txt (https://api.open-meteo.com/robots.txt), specifies that autonomous fetching of this page is not allowed, <useragent>ModelContextProtocol/1.0 (Autonomous; +https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers)</useragent>

The assistant must let the user know that it failed to view the page. The assistant may provide further guidance based on the above information.
The assistant can tell the user that they can try manually fetching the page by using the fetch prompt within their UI.


DESCRIPTION: Call the fetch tool to retrieve the current temperature for Chandler, AZ from wttr.in's simple text endpoint as a fallback because Open-Meteo disallowed autonomous access.

CHAIN OF THOUGHT: The primary Open-Meteo fetch was blocked by the site's robots.txt (autonomous fetching disallowed), so per the plan I should proceed to Fallback #1. wttr.in provides a simple no-key text endpoint that returns the current temperature for a place in an easy-to-parse format. Fetching https://wttr.in/Chandler?format=3 will likely return a single-line temperature (e.g., "Chandler: +104°F"). This tool call is necessary to obtain the current temperature using an alternative data source without requiring more input from the user.

Agent called MCP tool:

  SERVICE: 'fetch'

  ARGUMENTS: {'url': 'https://wttr.in/Chandler?format=3', 'max_length': 2000, 'raw': True}

 >>> Your current goals are: Tell me what the temperature is in Chandler, Arizona.

 >>> Your current plan (if any) is: Step-by-step plan I will follow to tell you the current temperature in Chandler, Arizona (using the available fetch tool and fallbacks):

1. Confirm target location
   - Use the given location "Chandler, Arizona" (no further disambiguation needed).

2. Choose primary data source (no API key required)
   - Primary: Open-Meteo free API (returns JSON current weather for coordinates).
   - Coordinates for Chandler, AZ: latitude = 33.3062, longitude = -111.8413.

3. Build primary fetch URL
   - URL: https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast?latitude=33.3062&longitude=-111.8413&current_weather=true

4. Fetch from primary source
   - Call fetch with the above URL, set max_length sufficiently large (e.g., 20000), raw = true (to get exact JSON).
   - If fetch succeeds and returns valid JSON, proceed to step 5.
   - If fetch fails (network error, non-JSON, or missing current_weather), go to step 7 (fallback).

5. Parse primary response
   - Extract current_weather.temperature (units: Celsius) and current_weather.time (ISO timestamp).
   - Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit: F = C * 9/5 + 32.
   - Round temperature to sensible precision (e.g., nearest 0.1°F or nearest whole degree as appropriate).

6. Present result to user
   - Report temperature with units, the observation time (timezone/ISO), and the data source (Open-Meteo).
   - Ask if the user wants the temperature in the other unit (C vs F), or wants forecast/current conditions, or a different data source.

7. Fallback #1 (if primary fails)
   - Use wttr.in simple text endpoint which requires no API key:
     - URL: https://wttr.in/Chandler?format=3
   - Fetch with max_length ~2000, raw = true (wttr.in returns plain text).
   - Parse returned line like "Chandler: +104°F" or similar, extract temperature and unit, then present as in step 6.

8. Fallback #2 (if wttr.in fails)
   - Use National Weather Service (NWS) API:
     - Step A: fetch https://api.weather.gov/points/33.3062,-111.8413 to get forecast/observation station URLs.
     - Step B: from that response, follow "observationStations" or "properties.relativeLocation" to find the nearest station and the observation endpoint.
     - Step C: fetch the latest observation endpoint (JSON) and extract temperature (ensure unit conversion if needed).
   - Present result as in step 6.

9. Error handling and user messages
   - If all fetch attempts fail, report inability to retrieve temperature, include error summary (network error / unexpected response / rate-limited), and ask whether to retry or use a different method/source.
   - If sources disagree, present each source's temperature and timestamp, note differences, and offer to pick a preferred source.

10. Logging and repeatability
   - Record which URL/source was used and the exact timestamp returned by the source so results can be verified or re-fetched later.
   - If the user requests periodic updates, propose an interval and repeat the above fetch/parse/present steps on that schedule.

That is the executable plan I will follow. Next step (with your confirmation) is to fetch the primary URL (Open-Meteo) and extract the current temperature. Shall I proceed?

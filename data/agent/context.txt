Consider the following when carrying out your tasks: 

Log of what has been done so far: 

DESCRIPTION: Call the fetch tool to request the wttr.in one-line status for Chandler (format=3) so I can parse the current temperature (defaults to °F unless parsing shows °C).

CHAIN OF THOUGHT: To determine the current temperature in Chandler, AZ I should fetch a concise, easily parsed weather response. The plan specifies wttr.in as the preferred primary source using the ?format=3 endpoint, and to default to Fahrenheit when the user has not specified units. A fetch call is necessary now to retrieve the one-line temperature string which I will parse and validate per the plan (sanity checks, retries if needed).

Agent called MCP tool:

  TOOL: 'fetch'

  SERVICE: 'fetch'

  ARGUMENTS: {'url': 'https://wttr.in/Chandler?format=3', 'max_length': 1000, 'raw': True}

  RESPONSE: 
Content type text/plain; charset=utf-8 cannot be simplified to markdown, but here is the raw content:
Contents of https://wttr.in/Chandler?format=3:
Chandler: ☀️   +101°F


 >>> Your current goals are: Tell me what the temperature is in Chandler, Arizona.

 >>> Your current plan (if any) is: Plan to determine the current temperature in Chandler, Arizona (step‑by‑step, including fetch actions, parsing, fallback and error handling)

1. Confirm desired units and precision
   - Action: If I should ask you, prompt whether you want temperature in Fahrenheit or Celsius (default to Fahrenheit for Chandler, AZ if no preference).
   - Why: Some users prefer °C; many U.S. contexts use °F.

2. Choose a primary data source
   - Preferred: wttr.in (simple plaintext response suitable for quick scraping).
   - Example primary URL: https://wttr.in/Chandler?format=3
     - Returns a short one-line status like "Chandler: +105°F" (easy to parse).
   - Alternate primary/formatted URL if you want ISO fields: https://wttr.in/Chandler?format=%l:+%t

3. Fetch primary URL
   - Tool call: fetch with
     - url = "https://wttr.in/Chandler?format=3"
     - max_length = 1000
     - raw = true (to get the exact response)
   - Parse result: extract temperature value and units from returned text using a simple regex (e.g., look for a number with optional +/− and then °F or °C or trailing F/C).

4. Validate parsed temperature
   - Check that the parsed value is numeric and includes units.
   - Sanity-check range (e.g., −60 to +140 °F for Chandler; −50 to +60 °C) to avoid parsing garbage.
   - If valid, proceed to step 6.

5. If primary source fails or parsing is invalid, try fallbacks (in order)
   - Fallback A: National Weather Service / weather.gov — fetch by city not direct, so use a more direct site:
     - Example: https://wttr.in/Chandler?m (metric) or https://wttr.in/Chandler?u (US units) — alternative wttr queries.
   - Fallback B: Weather.com (needs HTML parsing; less stable), e.g. https://weather.com/weather/today/l/Chandler+AZ? (HTML heavy)
     - Fetch with raw=true and parse the HTML for the temperature element (harder).
   - Fallback C: Open-Meteo public endpoints or another simple API (if available without API key), or use a different which returns concise JSON (e.g., https://api.weather.gov/points/{lat,lon} then forecast — more steps).
   - For each fallback:
     - Use fetch with appropriate max_length and raw settings.
     - Parse for numeric temperature and units.
     - Sanity-check as in step 4.

6. Cross-check (optional)
   - If multiple sources return values, compare them.
   - If discrepancies > a threshold (e.g., 3–5 °F), note both values and the sources to the user.

7. Compose final answer
   - Include:
     - The temperature value and unit (e.g., "Current temperature in Chandler, AZ is 105°F").
     - The source(s) used (e.g., wttr.in).
     - A timestamp (local time or UTC) indicating when the data was fetched.
     - If multiple sources: show each source and its value.
     - If parsing/fetch failed: explain the failure and offer to try another source or allow user to provide preferred source.

8. Error handling and retries
   - If fetch returns HTTP error or times out, retry once after a short pause.
   - If all sources fail, inform the user and offer to try a specific site or allow them to provide a ZIP code or coordinates to improve accuracy.

9. Privacy and rate-limit note
   - Mention (if relevant) that public endpoints may have rate limits; no personal data required to fetch weather for a city name.

10. Execute
   - Use the fetch tool to request the primary URL from step 3, parse and return the result to the user (or ask for unit preference first, if not pre-specified).

If you want, I can proceed now and fetch the current temperature for Chandler, AZ (tell me whether you prefer °F or °C).

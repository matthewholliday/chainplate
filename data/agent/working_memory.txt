DESCRIPTION: Fetch the concise current temperature string for Chandler, AZ from wttr.in so I can parse and report the temperature and unit.

CHAIN OF THOUGHT: To report the current temperature in Chandler, AZ I need to retrieve live data from a public weather endpoint. The plan specifies using wttr.in as the primary data source because it returns a concise temperature string without an API key. Calling the fetch tool with the wttr.in query for Chandler (?format=%t) is the next necessary step; I will parse the returned short string (e.g., '+87째F' or '29째C') to extract the numeric value and unit, then format the response for the user. The user did not specify units, so I will default to Fahrenheit if conversion is needed later.

Agent called MCP tool:

  TOOL: 'fetch'

  SERVICE: 'fetch'

  ARGUMENTS: {'url': 'https://wttr.in/Chandler?format=%t', 'max_length': 5000}

  RESPONSE: 
Content type text/plain; charset=utf-8 cannot be simplified to markdown, but here is the raw content:
Contents of https://wttr.in/Chandler?format=%t:
+101째F


DESCRIPTION: Parsed the wttr.in short-format response and prepared a concise temperature report for Chandler, AZ.

CHAIN OF THOUGHT: The fetch call to wttr.in/Chandler?format=%t already returned a concise temperature string (+101째F). This directly satisfies the requirement to obtain the current temperature and unit for Chandler, AZ, so no further tool calls or questions are necessary. I will parse the returned string and present the result to the user.

I have completed the task successfully.

DESCRIPTION: Fetch the Open-Meteo current weather JSON for Chandler, AZ (latitude=33.3062, longitude=-111.8413) to obtain the current temperature and observation time.

CHAIN OF THOUGHT: The plan's next step is to retrieve current weather data from the primary source (Open-Meteo) for Chandler, AZ using the known coordinates. A fetch call is required to get the JSON response so we can extract current_weather.temperature and timestamp, convert units, and present the result. No further user input is needed and Open-Meteo requires no API key, so proceeding with the fetch is consistent with the plan.

Agent called MCP tool:

  TOOL: 'fetch'

  SERVICE: 'fetch'

  ARGUMENTS: {'url': 'https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast?latitude=33.3062&longitude=-111.8413&current_weather=true', 'max_length': 20000, 'raw': True}

  RESPONSE: 
The sites robots.txt (https://api.open-meteo.com/robots.txt), specifies that autonomous fetching of this page is not allowed, <useragent>ModelContextProtocol/1.0 (Autonomous; +https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers)</useragent>

The assistant must let the user know that it failed to view the page. The assistant may provide further guidance based on the above information.
The assistant can tell the user that they can try manually fetching the page by using the fetch prompt within their UI.


DESCRIPTION: Call the fetch tool to retrieve the current temperature for Chandler, AZ from wttr.in's simple text endpoint as a fallback because Open-Meteo disallowed autonomous access.

CHAIN OF THOUGHT: The primary Open-Meteo fetch was blocked by the site's robots.txt (autonomous fetching disallowed), so per the plan I should proceed to Fallback #1. wttr.in provides a simple no-key text endpoint that returns the current temperature for a place in an easy-to-parse format. Fetching https://wttr.in/Chandler?format=3 will likely return a single-line temperature (e.g., "Chandler: +104°F"). This tool call is necessary to obtain the current temperature using an alternative data source without requiring more input from the user.

Agent called MCP tool:

  TOOL: 'fetch'

  SERVICE: 'fetch'

  ARGUMENTS: {'url': 'https://wttr.in/Chandler?format=3', 'max_length': 2000, 'raw': True}

  RESPONSE: 
Content type text/plain; charset=utf-8 cannot be simplified to markdown, but here is the raw content:
Contents of https://wttr.in/Chandler?format=3:
Chandler: ☀️   +101°F


DESCRIPTION: Report the current temperature in Chandler, AZ using the successful wttr.in fallback fetch.

CHAIN OF THOUGHT: The primary Open-Meteo fetch was blocked by the site's robots.txt, so I followed the plan's fallback to wttr.in. I fetched https://wttr.in/Chandler?format=3 which returned a single-line result indicating the current temperature. Because that fetch succeeded and provides the temperature, the task (report current temperature) is complete.

I have completed the task successfully.

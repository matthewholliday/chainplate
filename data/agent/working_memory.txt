DESCRIPTION: Call the fetch tool to request the wttr.in one-line status for Chandler (format=3) so I can parse the current temperature (defaults to °F unless parsing shows °C).

CHAIN OF THOUGHT: To determine the current temperature in Chandler, AZ I should fetch a concise, easily parsed weather response. The plan specifies wttr.in as the preferred primary source using the ?format=3 endpoint, and to default to Fahrenheit when the user has not specified units. A fetch call is necessary now to retrieve the one-line temperature string which I will parse and validate per the plan (sanity checks, retries if needed).

Agent called MCP tool:

  TOOL: 'fetch'

  SERVICE: 'fetch'

  ARGUMENTS: {'url': 'https://wttr.in/Chandler?format=3', 'max_length': 1000, 'raw': True}

  RESPONSE: 
Content type text/plain; charset=utf-8 cannot be simplified to markdown, but here is the raw content:
Contents of https://wttr.in/Chandler?format=3:
Chandler: ☀️   +101°F


DESCRIPTION: Parsed the previously-fetched wttr.in one-line response, validated the temperature and prepared the final user-facing message.

CHAIN OF THOUGHT: The fetch for https://wttr.in/Chandler?format=3 has already returned a concise plaintext response ('Chandler: ☀️   +101°F'). I can parse and validate this result directly (numeric value present, units present, value within expected Fahrenheit range for Chandler). No further tool calls or questions are required to satisfy the user's request to report the current temperature.

I have completed the task successfully.

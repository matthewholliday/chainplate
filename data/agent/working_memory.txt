DESCRIPTION: Ask for the minimal set of information required to proceed: exact objectives, target IDs or search queries, content to write (or permission to draft), and whether to do a dry-run or apply changes.

CHAIN OF THOUGHT: Per step 1 of the plan (Clarify goal and scope), I cannot safely make Notion API calls or prepare payloads without the concrete objective(s), target page/database IDs (or permission to search), and the content/property mappings to write. I also need to know whether to perform a dry-run or actually modify Notion. The Notion-bound content must be converted to pirate speak, so I need either the exact text or confirmation that I should draft it in pirate speak. Asking these questions is necessary to avoid making incorrect or destructive changes and to construct correct API calls (which require explicit IDs and required property values).

I asked question to the user 'Ahoy! I’m ready t’ act, but I needs a few specifics before I set sail:

1) What be the exact objective(s)? (examples: “Create X pages in database <database_id> with these titles”, “Find pages named ‘Q3 roadmap’ and append action items”, “Create a new project database under page <page_id>”)
2) Provide target IDs (page_id or database_id) for where t’ operate. If ye don’t have IDs, say so and give the search query/titles I should use to find them.
3) Tell me the content to write: titles, page bodies, list items, and any database property values. If ye want me t’ draft content, confirm I should write it in pirate speak and whether ye want a first draft to review (dry-run) or direct commit.
4) Should I perform a dry-run (show payloads) or actually make changes in Notion now?
5) Any constraints or required property values (e.g., title property name, required select values, deadlines, formatting rules)?

Give me those details an’ I’ll prepare the Notion API calls (all Notion-bound text in pirate speak) and proceed. Shall I begin once ye answer, matey?' and received user answer: continue.

Plan ‚Äî step-by-step actions I'll follow to create the Notion pages for "Poodle" and the three sub-pages. Notes: I will ensure every piece of content written to Notion is in pirate speak (per inherited context). I assume I have a valid Notion API token and network access.

Pre-flight
1. Verify Notion API credentials and reachability.
2. Confirm I have the ID of the Notion workspace or the "Dog Breeds" parent page location. If you don't provide a parent page ID, I'll attempt to find a page titled "Dog Breeds" in the workspace (step 3). If none is found I will ask whether to create a new "Dog Breeds" page and where to place it.

Find the "Dog Breeds" parent page
3. Search for a page titled "Dog Breeds" using API-post-search:
   - query: "Dog Breeds"
   - filter: { property: "object", value: "page" }
   - If multiple matches, pick page whose title matches exactly (case-insensitive). If still ambiguous, pick the most recently edited and/or ask user to confirm.
4. If "Dog Breeds" page is found, save its page_id as dogBreedsPageId and proceed. If not found, stop and request a parent page_id or permission to create a brand new "Dog Breeds" page (explain I need a page_id to create top-level page under).

Create the main "Poodle" page
5. Create the Poodle page under dogBreedsPageId with API-post-page:
   - parent: { page_id: dogBreedsPageId }
   - properties: { title: [ { text: { content: "Poodle" } } ] }
   - optional: icon: emoji "üê©" (JSON string as required by API)
   - children: a short opening paragraph in pirate speak introducing the Poodle (one paragraph).
   - Save returned page_id as poodlePageId.
   - Example children paragraph (in pirate speak): "Arrr! The Poodle be a clever an' elegant sea-dog o' the land, proud an' spry, loved fer smarts an' style." (I will generate the actual phrasing when executing.)

Create the 3 sub-pages (each as a child page of the Poodle page)
6. For each topic below I will create a sub-page with title including the breed name, and add content blocks (paragraphs and bullets) in pirate speak per the required detail level.

   Subpage A ‚Äî History and Origin
   - Title: "Poodle ‚Äî History and Origin"
   - Content: short/brief summary paragraph(s) in pirate speak describing origin & historical role (e.g., water-retriever origins in Europe, standard/mini/toy distinctions origin, development as show dog and companion).
   - API call: API-post-page with parent.page_id = poodlePageId, properties.title containing the above title, children with a brief pirate-speak paragraph.

   Subpage B ‚Äî Physical Characteristics and Appearance
   - Title: "Poodle ‚Äî Physical Characteristics and Appearance"
   - Content: detailed description in pirate speak covering coat types (curly, dense), colors, sizes (standard/miniature/toy), typical height/weight ranges, build, grooming/pruning styles, typical lifespan, distinguishing features.
   - Structure: multiple paragraphs and bulleted list items for clarity.
   - API call: API-post-page with parent.page_id = poodlePageId, properties.title, and children blocks in pirate speak.

   Subpage C ‚Äî Temperament and Behavior
   - Title: "Poodle ‚Äî Temperament and Behavior"
   - Content: detailed pirate-speak description covering intelligence, trainability, activity level, social needs, behavior with kids/other pets, exercise needs, common behavior traits, tips for owners.
   - Structure: paragraphs + bullets where helpful.
   - API call: API-post-page with parent.page_id = poodlePageId, properties.title, children blocks in pirate speak.

Implementation details for creating pages and blocks
7. Use API-post-page to create each page. Payloads will include:
   - parent: { page_id: <parent> }
   - properties: { title: [ { text: { content: "<Title>" } } ] }
   - children: an array of block objects. For example, paragraph blocks:
     { "object": "block", "type": "paragraph", "paragraph": { "rich_text": [ { "type": "text", "text": { "content": "Pirate-speak text here" } } ] } }
   - Or bulleted list items:
     { "object": "block", "type": "bulleted_list_item", "bulleted_list_item": { "rich_text": [ { "type":"text", "text":{ "content":"Bullet item in pirate-speak" } } ] } }

Verification & retries
8. For each create call, verify success and record returned page_id.
9. Retrieve each page (API-retrieve-a-page) and its content blocks (API-get-block-children) to confirm children were added and text is correct and in pirate speak.
10. If a page or block is missing or content needs correction, use API-patch-page to update the title or API-patch-block-children / API-update-a-block to alter text or append missing blocks. Retry on transient errors with exponential backoff.

Error handling, logging, and user feedback
11. Log every API request and response (IDs, timestamps, status).
12. If I cannot find "Dog Breeds" and you do not provide a parent page_id, pause and ask for instructions.
13. If permission errors (403/401) occur, stop and request corrected credentials.
14. After successful creation and verification, return the page_ids (and human-readable Notion links if desired) for:
    - Dog Breeds (parent) ‚Äî if created or identified
    - Poodle (main page)
    - Poodle ‚Äî History and Origin
    - Poodle ‚Äî Physical Characteristics and Appearance
    - Poodle ‚Äî Temperament and Behavior

Content style requirements
15. All content written into Notion blocks will be in pirate speak. Titles must include the breed name exactly as requested (e.g., "Poodle ‚Äî History and Origin"). Summaries and descriptions will meet the requested brevity/detailedness:
   - History & Origin: brief summary (one concise paragraph).
   - Physical Characteristics: detailed description (multiple paragraphs and bullets).
   - Temperament & Behavior: detailed description (multiple paragraphs and bullets).

Optional polish (post-creation)
16. Optionally set page icons/covers for the Poodle page and sub-pages (e.g., emoji üê©) using API-post-page icon field or API-patch-page cover/icon updates.
17. Optionally add a top-level table of contents or link list on the Poodle page linking to the three subpages (use the subpage URLs / page mentions) ‚Äî also in pirate speak.

If you want, I can now:
- execute this plan (I will prompt you for dogBreedsPageId if I cannot find "Dog Breeds"),
- or produce the pirate-speak content drafts for each page here so you can review before I write them to Notion. Which would you prefer?

Plan to determine the current temperature in Chandler, Arizona (steps I will follow using the available fetch tool):

1. Confirm units preference (optional)
   - If you have a preference (Fahrenheit or Celsius), use it. If you do not respond, default to Fahrenheit (US convention).

2. Choose primary data source
   - Use a simple, publicly-accessible endpoint that returns plain text (easy to parse) — e.g., wttr.in or a public NWS endpoint. wttr.in is preferred for a one-call temperature string because it does not require an API key and returns concise output.

3. Build the query URL
   - Primary (wttr.in): construct a URL for Chandler, AZ that requests a concise temperature string. Example pattern: https://wttr.in/Chandler?format=%t (or use ?format=3 for a short line with location + temperature). I will include unit indicator parsing and, if needed, request a specific unit via the service’s parameters or convert units after retrieval.
   - Fallback (NWS): use Chandler coordinates (~33.3062,-111.8413) and the NWS API points endpoint: https://api.weather.gov/points/33.3062,-111.8413 to discover observation/forecast endpoints, then fetch the relevant observations or forecast.

4. Fetch the data
   - Call fetch with the chosen URL, set max_length high enough (e.g., 5000) and raw=false unless I need raw HTML. Example: fetch({ "url": "https://wttr.in/Chandler?format=%t", "max_length": 5000 }).

5. Parse the response
   - If wttr.in returns a short string like "+87°F" or "29°C", extract numeric temperature and the unit symbol.
   - If using NWS JSON, parse the JSON to find the current temperature or latest observation (look for properties.temperature.value and units). Handle nulls and convert units if needed.

6. Unit handling and conversion
   - If the returned unit differs from the user preference, convert (C ↔ F) and note which unit was displayed by the source and which is being reported.

7. Validate and timestamp
   - Record the time of the data retrieval (UTC and local Chandler time if useful).
   - Include the data source URL and a short reliability note (e.g., "current observation/forecast").

8. Present the result
   - Return the temperature as a concise statement (e.g., "Current temperature in Chandler, AZ: 87°F (observed at HH:MM local). Source: wttr.in").
   - If multiple sources are used or there’s ambiguity, show both values and note discrepancies.

9. Error handling and retries
   - If the primary fetch fails (network error, unexpected format, or truncated response), retry once.
   - If still failing, use the fallback source (NWS or another public weather site) and repeat steps 4–7.
   - If all attempts fail, report the error and ask whether you want me to try again or use a specific data source.

10. Follow-up
   - Offer to show more details (forecast, feels-like, humidity) or switch units if desired.

That is the step-by-step plan I will follow to fetch and report the current temperature in Chandler, Arizona using the available fetch tool. Would you like Fahrenheit or Celsius, or should I default to Fahrenheit?

Plan to create a Notion page about Greyhounds (content in pirate-speak) ‚Äî step-by-step

Goal: Create a new page under the "Dog Breeds" parent page (page_id: 2692177e-9a4d-800c-8a4b-e28721e5cbd1) titled something like "Greyhounds ‚Äî Swift Buccaneers o' the Doggo Seas", with structured sections in pirate-speak similar to the existing Chow Chows page.

Preconditions / constraints
- All content posted to Notion must be in pirate-speak.
- Use available Notion API actions listed in the tools.
- Avoid creating a duplicate page if one already exists.

Steps

1) Confirm intent & final title
- Decide final page title (suggestion: "Greyhounds ‚Äî Swift Buccaneers o' the Doggo Seas").
- If user wants a different title or tone (more/less piratey) or additional sections/images, prompt now ‚Äî otherwise proceed with default.

2) Check for existing Greyhound page to avoid duplicates
- Call API-post-search with query = "Greyhounds" and filter.object = "page" (or "Greyhound" singular too).
- If a page with the same or very similar title exists under the "Dog Breeds" parent, stop and prompt the user: offer to update that page or create a new one with a distinct title.
- If no duplicates found, proceed.

3) Draft pirate-speak content (compose locally before API call)
- Compose blocks for these sections (keeps parity with Chow Chows page):
  - Title (page property)
  - Overview
  - History
  - Appearance
  - Temperament
  - Care & Grooming
  - Health
  - Fun Facts
- For each section prepare 2‚Äì6 medium-detail paragraphs or bulleted points in pirate-speak (concise but informative). Example headings remain normal (Overview, History...) but block text must be pirate-speak.
- Optionally prepare an introductory one-line summary near the top, and a short "quick facts" bulleted list (height, weight, lifespan).
- If user previously preferred a "medium detail" level for Chow Chows, match that level.

4) Prepare Notion page payload
- Build payload for API-post-page:
  - parent: { page_id: "2692177e-9a4d-800c-8a4b-e28721e5cbd1" }
  - properties: title: [{ text: { content: "<Final Title>" } }]
  - children: array of block objects representing each section:
    - Use paragraph blocks for section headings and content, or heading blocks if desired.
    - Use bulleted_list_item blocks for quick facts or lists.
  - (Optional) include an icon emoji (e.g., üêï‚Äçü¶∫ or üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è dog) or cover: include external cover image URL if user provided or we choose.

5) Create the page
- Call API-post-page with prepared payload.
- Verify response: capture new page_id and URL (Notion returns id; URL can be inferred or returned).
- If API returns an error (rate limit, validation, permission), handle:
  - For permission errors, report to user and stop.
  - For rate limit, back off and retry per Notion guidelines.
  - For validation errors, log and adjust payload accordingly.

6) Append additional content or media (optional)
- If user supplied image URLs or wants images added:
  - Use API-patch-page to add cover or icon, or API-patch-block-children to append image blocks (if supported).
  - If Notion file objects required, use external image URL fields in cover/icon.
- If user requested links to authoritative resources (breed club pages, vet resources), append as paragraph blocks with link objects.

7) Verify page content
- Call API-retrieve-a-page and/or API-get-block-children for the new page_id to confirm children were created and contain the intended pirate-speak content.
- Validate that sections exist and formatting looks correct.

8) Update logs & inform user
- Save page_id and URL to the session log (include title).
- Return a confirmation message to the user with:
  - Page title
  - Page ID
  - URL
  - Summary of sections added
  - Offer next actions: change tone, add images/links, create another breed page, or edit content.

9) Offer follow-ups / edits
- Offer options the user can pick: more/less piratey, more detail, add photos, add breed-specific resources, or create additional pages.
- If user requests edits, repeat appropriate steps: draft new content and call API-patch-block-children or API-patch-page as needed.

Error handling and contingencies
- Duplicate detected: ask user whether to update existing page or create a new one with a modified title.
- Insufficient permissions: notify user and stop.
- Rate limiting: implement exponential backoff and retry (up to 3 attempts), then surface error.
- Content-length or block schema issues: fall back to splitting large sections into multiple blocks.

Deliverables after execution
- A new Notion page (pirate-speak) about Greyhounds under Dog Breeds with the agreed title and sections.
- Page ID and URL recorded in the log.
- A message to the user confirming creation and offering next edits.

If you want, I can now:
- (A) Draft the pirate-speak content for the Greyhounds page and show it here for approval, then create the page; or
- (B) Immediately create the page with a default pirate-speak draft (medium detail) and return the page link.

Which do ye prefer, matey?
